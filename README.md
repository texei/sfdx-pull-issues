# sfdx-pull-issues
This repo is used to track `sfdx force:source:pull` issues, mainly holes in Source Tracking.  
So basically, doing stuff on the Org, pulling everything, and something that should have been pulled has not been.

This breaks trust in SFDX Pull functionality, and leads to issues/bug after deploying the changes.
